    summary:
      "In the mid-6th century BCE, the ancient Near East was a patchwork of rival kingdoms. The Medes controlled modern Iran, the Lydians ruled wealthy cities in Turkey (their king, Croesus, was legendarily rich), and the mighty Babylonians dominated Mesopotamia with the greatest city in the world. These kingdoms traded, fought, and jockeyed for power. Into this world was born Cyrus, a Persian prince living under Median rule. Nobody expected him to change everything.\n\n" +
      "In 550 BCE, Cyrus did the unthinkable: he rebelled against his overlord, the Median king Astyages (possibly his own grandfather). When Astyages marched his army to crush the rebellion, something shocking happened—the Median soldiers deserted their king and joined Cyrus instead! Cyrus captured the Median capital of Ecbatana and its treasures, founding what would become the Persian Empire. But he didn't stop there. Around 546 BCE, he marched west against Lydia. When the Lydian cavalry charged, Cyrus put camels at the front of his army. The horses, terrified by the strange smell, panicked and fled—and Lydia fell. Finally, in 539 BCE, Cyrus conquered Babylon itself, the crown jewel of the ancient world. His army entered the city without a major battle because the Babylonians were fed up with their own unpopular king. Within eleven years, Cyrus had built the largest empire the world had ever seen, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to India.\n\n" +
      "What made Cyrus truly revolutionary wasn't just conquest—it was how he ruled. Previous empires like Assyria had terrorized conquered peoples, burning cities and enslaving populations. Cyrus did the opposite. He let conquered peoples keep their religions, customs, and local leaders. He freed the Jews from Babylonian captivity and helped them rebuild their temple. He divided his empire into provinces called satrapies, each with a governor who respected local traditions. He built a 1,677-mile road system so messages could travel across the empire in nine days instead of ninety. The Cyrus Cylinder, inscribed after he took Babylon, proclaimed religious freedom—an idea so revolutionary that 2,500 years later, it would echo in modern human rights declarations. Cyrus proved that tolerance could be more powerful than terror, and his empire lasted 200 years. Even Alexander the Great, who conquered Persia two centuries later, visited Cyrus's tomb with respect. The Persian founder had shown the world a new way to build an empire.",
    funFact:
      "When Cyrus conquered the wealthy kingdom of Lydia, he used a clever trick: he put camels at the front of his army. The Lydian cavalry horses had never seen or smelled camels before and panicked, throwing their riders and fleeing! This helped Cyrus win a battle that seemed impossible.",
