    summary:
      "In the summer of 776 BCE, something unprecedented happened in a remote valley in southwestern Greece. Athletes from different Greek city-states—communities that usually fought each other—gathered at Olympia for a religious festival and sporting competition. They declared a sacred truce, setting aside their wars for the duration of the games. A cook named Coroebus won the only event, a 200-yard footrace, becoming the first recorded Olympic champion. This moment marked the beginning of the Olympic Games, which would continue for over 1,000 years and eventually inspire the modern Olympics we know today. But the ancient games were wildly different from their modern version—far more religious, more brutal, and exclusively for Greek men competing completely naked.\n\n" +
      "The Olympics weren't just about sports—they were a religious festival honoring Zeus, king of the Greek gods. Olympia was Zeus's sacred sanctuary, home to his massive temple and a 40-foot statue covered in gold and ivory (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). Every four years, Greek city-states would declare the Olympic Truce (ekecheiria), pausing all wars so athletes and spectators could travel safely to the games. Breaking this truce was considered sacrilege. The games began with sacrifices to Zeus—100 oxen burned on his altar—and athletes swore oaths before his statue. Winners didn't receive gold medals; they got olive wreaths cut from Zeus's sacred olive tree. These victors became instant celebrities, returning home to parades, free meals for life, and sometimes even having statues erected in their honor. Poets like Pindar wrote victory odes celebrating them as almost superhuman.\n\n" +
      "The ancient Olympics were far more intense than modern games. Athletes competed naked (the Greek word 'gymnos' means 'naked,' giving us 'gymnasium'). Events included footraces, wrestling, boxing (with leather straps wrapped around fists—no gloves, no weight classes, fights until someone gave up or was knocked unconscious), pankration (a brutal 'no-holds-barred' combat sport where only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden), chariot racing (extremely dangerous—horses frequently crashed and drivers died), and the pentathlon (running, jumping, discus, javelin, and wrestling). There were no silver or bronze medals—only winners mattered. The games lasted five days and attracted tens of thousands of spectators who camped in tents, watched performances by poets and philosophers, and celebrated Greek culture. Women were banned from competing and even from watching (on pain of death, though there's only one recorded case of a woman being caught).\n\n" +
      "Why do the ancient Olympics matter? They represent one of history's most remarkable examples of shared culture overcoming political division. Ancient Greece was never a unified nation—it was hundreds of independent city-states that often warred with each other. Athens and Sparta, Corinth and Thebes—they all fought for power. Yet every four years, they came together at Olympia under sacred truce, competing for glory rather than territory. The games reinforced Greek identity: if you spoke Greek and worshiped the Greek gods, you could participate; everyone else was a 'barbarian' (literally: someone who says 'bar-bar' instead of speaking Greek). The Olympics survived for 1,169 years, from 776 BCE until Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned them in 393 CE for being pagan. They were forgotten for 1,500 years until French educator Pierre de Coubertin revived them in 1896, inspired by the ancient ideal of peaceful international competition. Today's Olympics, watched by billions, carry forward that ancient Greek dream: that for a few weeks, the world can set aside conflicts and celebrate human excellence.",
    funFact:
      "Ancient Olympic athletes competed completely naked! The tradition supposedly started when a runner's shorts fell off during a race and he won anyway—after that, athletes decided clothes just slowed them down. The Greek word 'gymnos' means 'naked,' which is why we call sports facilities 'gymnasiums'!",

    summary:
      "Around 750 BCE, somewhere in the Greek-speaking world, a poet—perhaps blind, perhaps not even a single person—composed two of history's most influential stories. The Iliad tells of a ten-year war over a kidnapped queen, where heroes fought gods and a wooden horse won the day. The Odyssey follows one warrior's ten-year struggle to get home, facing monsters, witches, and his own pride. These weren't just entertainment—they were the foundational texts of Greek culture, teaching values like honor, cleverness, loyalty, and the proper way to treat guests. For over 2,700 years, people have been reading, performing, adapting, and arguing about Homer's epics. They've influenced everything from Virgil's Aeneid to modern movies, making the Trojan War and Odysseus's journey part of humanity's shared story.\n\n" +
      "We know almost nothing certain about Homer himself. Ancient Greeks believed he was a blind poet from Ionia (modern Turkey coast) who composed the Iliad and Odyssey around 750 BCE. But modern scholars debate whether 'Homer' was one person, several poets, or a tradition of storytellers whose work was eventually written down. What we do know is that these epics were composed in the oral tradition—meant to be performed aloud, with formulaic phrases ('rosy-fingered dawn,' 'wine-dark sea') that helped poets remember thousands of lines. The stories themselves are set during the Bronze Age Mycenaean civilization (around 1200 BCE), but they were composed centuries later, creating a fascinating mix of historical memory, legend, and the poet's own 8th-century BCE world. The Iliad focuses on just 51 days during the Trojan War's final year, centering on Achilles's rage after his war prize is taken. The Odyssey is more expansive, following Odysseus's fantastical ten-year journey home after the war ends.\n\n" +
      "What made Homer's epics revolutionary? First, they established literature as we know it—complex character-driven narratives with themes, symbolism, and moral questions. The Iliad isn't just battle scenes; it's a meditation on mortality, honor, and the tragedy of war. When the Trojan prince Hector says goodbye to his wife and baby son, knowing he'll die fighting Achilles, it's one of literature's most heartbreaking moments. The Odyssey explores identity ('Who am I if I've been gone 20 years?'), temptation (Circe, the Lotus-Eaters), and perseverance. Second, Homer's epics became the Greek Bible—every educated Greek knew them by heart, quoted them, and learned ethics from them. They defined Greek concepts of heroism (kleos—undying glory), proper behavior (xenia—hospitality to strangers), and human excellence (arete). Third, they influenced all of Western literature. Virgil wrote the Aeneid as a Roman response to Homer. Dante put Virgil (and through him, Homer) as his guide through Hell. Joyce's Ulysses retells the Odyssey in 1904 Dublin. The Iliad and Odyssey aren't just old stories—they're the DNA of Western storytelling.\n\n" +
      "But Homer's influence goes beyond literature. The Iliad and Odyssey shaped how Greeks understood their past, creating a shared cultural memory that united people from Sicily to the Black Sea. They sparked one of history's great debates: did the Trojan War really happen? In the 1870s, archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann literally used the Iliad as a treasure map and discovered Troy in Turkey, proving there was some historical basis for the legend. Homer's works also raise timeless questions: Is glory worth dying for? Is cleverness better than strength? How do we deal with PTSD (Achilles clearly suffers from it)? What do we owe to strangers? The fact that we still ask these questions shows Homer's enduring power. These 2,750-year-old poems about Bronze Age warriors still speak to us because they capture universal human experiences—grief, love, rage, homesickness, determination. That's why Homer matters: not because ancient literature is 'good for you,' but because these stories are so powerful they've survived nearly three millennia and show no signs of fading.",
    funFact:
      "Homer's Odyssey might contain the first description of a 'wandering eye'—literally! The one-eyed Cyclops Polyphemus was blinded by Odysseus, who told the monster his name was 'Nobody.' When the other Cyclopes asked who hurt him, Polyphemus yelled 'Nobody is hurting me!'—so they didn't help. This pun worked in ancient Greek too, showing Homer's clever wordplay!",

          explanation: "Surprisingly, the Iliad doesn't cover the entire Trojan War—it focuses on just 51 days in the war's tenth year, centered on Achilles's anger after losing his war prize and his eventual return to battle after his friend Patroclus dies."

          explanation: "Odysseus got the Cyclops drunk, told him his name was 'Nobody,' then blinded him with a heated stake. When other Cyclopes asked who hurt him, Polyphemus yelled 'Nobody!'—so they didn't help. Odysseus escaped by clinging to the undersides of sheep leaving the cave. Classic cleverness!"

          correctIndex: 1,
          explanation: "Homer's epics were the Greek 'Bible'—they taught values like honor, hospitality (xenia), and proper behavior. Every educated Greek knew them by heart. They defined what it meant to be Greek, taught ethics through stories, and created a shared cultural identity across hundreds of independent city-states."
